The program provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

2. After entering the text, the program displays a menu with the following options:

    c - Number of non-whitespace characters: Calculates and displays the count of non-whitespace characters in the entered       text.

    s - Shorten spaces: Removes extra spaces between words in the text and displays the edited text.
